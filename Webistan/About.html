                    <h2>John Wick: Chapter 2 (2014)</h2>
                    <p>In "John Wick," we're introduced to the titular character, played by Keanu Reeves. He's a retired hitman mourning the loss of his wife, Helen, who passed away from an illness. After her death, he receives a puppy named Daisy, a final gift from Helen to help him cope with her absence.

                    One day, while refueling his car, he encounters a trio of Russian gangsters led by Iosef Tarasov, who admires Wick's classic car and wants to buy it. Wick refuses, and the thugs break into his house, steal his car, and kill Daisy in the process. What they don't realize is that they've awakened a sleeping giant. Wick, revealed to be a legendary hitman with formidable skills, comes out of retirement seeking vengeance for the death of his beloved dog.

                    Wick's quest for retribution takes him into the heart of the Russian mob, led by Viggo Tarasov, Iosef's father. Despite Viggo's attempts to placate Wick, promising to leave him alone if he stops his rampage, Wick persists, tearing through hordes of henchmen with cold efficiency.

                    Throughout the film, we witness Wick's tactical prowess and his reputation as an unstoppable force in the criminal underworld. Along the way, we learn more about his past, his connections to various characters, and the intricate network of assassins that inhabit his world.

                    In the climax, Wick confronts Viggo and his remaining men at a nightclub. After a fierce battle, Wick emerges victorious, but not without sustaining injuries. Despite his triumph, the consequences of his actions linger, setting the stage for future conflicts and adventures in the subsequent films.</p>

                    <h2>John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017)</h2>
                    <p>In "John Wick: Chapter 2," we find John Wick still dealing with the aftermath of his actions from the first film. He retrieves his stolen car from Abram Tarasov, Viggo's brother, who has taken over the family's criminal operations. However, even though he's completed his mission for vengeance, Wick's troubles are far from over.

                    Santino D'Antonio, a powerful Italian crime lord, calls in an old debt from Wick. Bound by a blood oath, Wick is forced to accept Santino's request to assassinate his sister, Gianna, so Santino can claim her seat at the High Table, a council of crime lords governing the underworld.

                    Reluctantly, Wick travels to Rome to fulfill his obligation. There, he encounters old allies, such as Winston, the owner of the Continental Hotel, and the Bowery King, a leader of a group of underground assassins. Wick faces numerous challenges as he navigates the treacherous world of international assassins and attempts to complete his mission.

                    However, complications arise when Gianna chooses to take her own life rather than let Wick kill her. This triggers a series of events that lead to Wick becoming a target himself, with a massive bounty placed on his head. Now hunted by assassins from all corners of the globe, Wick must fight his way out of Rome and back to New York City to confront Santino and settle the score.

                    The film culminates in a breathtaking showdown at the Continental, where the rules of the assassin world are put to the test. Wick faces off against Santino and his army of mercenaries in a brutal and intense battle that pushes him to his limits. In the end, Wick emerges victorious once again, but the consequences of his actions set the stage for even greater challenges in the next installment.</p>

                    <h2>John Wick: Chapter 3 (2019)</h2>
                    <p>In "John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum," we pick up right where the previous film left off. John Wick is now on the run after being declared "excommunicado" by the High Table for killing Santino D'Antonio on Continental Hotel grounds, violating one of the most sacred rules of the assassin underworld.

                    With a $14 million bounty on his head and every contract killer in New York City eager to claim it, Wick must use all his skills and resources to survive. He seeks refuge and assistance from old allies like the Bowery King, who provides him with information and support, and Sofia, a fellow assassin played by Halle Berry, who owes him a debt.

                    As Wick fights his way through waves of assassins sent by the High Table, he seeks to find a way to clear his name and regain his freedom. Along the way, he uncovers more about the inner workings of the High Table and its network of operatives.

                    The film takes us on a thrilling journey through various locations, including New York City, Casablanca, and the deserts of Morocco. Each encounter pushes Wick to his limits as he battles foes with incredible skill and determination.

                    Ultimately, Wick confronts the Elder, a high-ranking member of the High Table, who offers him a chance at redemption in exchange for his loyalty. Wick accepts the offer, symbolized by cutting off his finger as a sign of fealty.

                    With his excommunication lifted, Wick is once again free to roam the world of assassins, but the repercussions of his actions continue to reverberate, setting the stage for further adventures in the franchise.</p>
